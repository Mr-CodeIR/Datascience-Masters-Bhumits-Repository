    "# Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only\n",
    "the essential features to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "example of abstraction can be seen in a Vehicle object. The Vehicle object might have data such as the number of wheels and the type of engine. The methods for a Vehicle object might include the ability to start the engine and drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the user's perspective, they don't need to know the specifics of how the engine works or how many wheels a vehicle has. They only need to know the essential features, such as being able to start the engine and drive. This allows for creating a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with Vehicle objects, while hiding the implementation details that are not relevant to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling the data and methods that operate on that data within a\n",
    "single unit, or object. This protects the data from external access or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of encapsulation can be seen in a Person object. The data for a person might include their name, age,\n",
    "and address. The methods for a person might include the ability to set the name, set the age, and get the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "By encapsulating the data and methods within a single Person object, it becomes a self-contained unit. The data can\n",
    "only be accessed or modified through the methods provided by the Person object, which helps to protect the data and\n",
    "makes it easier to work with. For example, when setting the age, a method can be used to validate that the age is \n",
    "within a certain range before actually setting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class\n",
    "inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the base class, and it can add new attributes or override the existing\n",
    "behaviors if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism can be explained in a simpler way as the ability for objects of different types to respond to the same\n",
    "method call in a way that is specific to their individual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the speak method. A dog object, when asked to speak, might return \"Woof!\", while a cat object,\n",
    "when asked to speak, might return \"Meow!\". Both the dog and the cat objects respond to the speak method, but they \n",
    "each do so in a way that is specific to their individual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for creating a single interface for interacting with objects of different types, which can greatly simplify\n",
    "the code and make it more maintainable."
